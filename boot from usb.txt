### Step 1: Boot from an SD Card and Open `raspi-config`
1. Insert an SD card with Raspberry Pi OS and boot the Raspberry Pi.
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```

### Step 2: Update the Bootloader Settings
1. Navigate to `Advanced Options` (on older versions, this might be under `Boot Options`).
2. Select `Boot Order`.
3. Choose `USB Boot` or `USB and SD Boot` depending on your preference (for Raspberry Pi 4, it’s usually labeled as "USB Boot").
4. Exit `raspi-config` and allow the system to reboot if prompted.

### Step 3: Prepare the USB Drive
1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS to the USB drive using tools like [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) or [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
2. Once flashed, insert the USB drive into one of the Raspberry Pi's USB ports.

### Step 4: Boot from the USB Drive
1. Power off the Raspberry Pi.
2. Remove the SD card.
3. Turn the Raspberry Pi back on. It should now boot from the USB drive.

### Note:
- For **Raspberry Pi 4**, the firmware generally supports USB boot natively, so enabling it via `raspi-config` should work without needing further steps.
- For **Raspberry Pi 3B+**, it also supports USB boot without much configuration.
- For **Raspberry Pi 3 (non-B+ models)**, a one-time tweak to the OTP (One-Time Programmable memory) is required to enable USB boot. You can enable it by running:
   ```bash
   echo program_usb_boot_mode=1 | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt
   ```

Once this is done, your Raspberry Pi should be able to boot from USB devices.
